AI Agents are autonomous or semi-autonomous systems that perceive their environment, reason about it, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They combine sensing, decision-making, and acting in a loop, allowing them to perform tasks without constant human intervention. AI agents can range from simple rule-based bots to complex multi-agent systems that collaborate to solve problems.

There are different types of AI agents: reactive agents that respond to current inputs, deliberative agents that plan using an internal model of the environment, and learning agents that improve their performance over time using machine learning. Some agents are goal-oriented, optimizing actions to achieve specific outcomes, while others are utility-based, seeking to maximize a defined utility function.

In practical applications, AI agents are used for chatbots, virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, trading bots, and workflow automation. They can retrieve information from knowledge bases, interact with APIs, execute tasks, and reason using LLMs. Integrating RAG with AI agents enables them to answer domain-specific questions accurately while deciding whether to use their internal knowledge or external tools.

Designing effective AI agents involves considerations like context awareness, error handling, transparency, and ethical behavior. Logging decisions, actions, and reasoning steps is essential for monitoring, evaluation, and improving agent performance. By combining retrieval, reasoning, and action execution, AI agents form the foundation of intelligent, autonomous systems in many domains.
