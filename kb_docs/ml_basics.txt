Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms identify patterns in historical data, generalize from them, and apply that knowledge to new, unseen data. It is widely used in areas such as healthcare, finance, marketing, robotics, and natural language processing.

There are three main types of ML: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, models are trained on labeled data to predict outcomes or classify inputs. Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or groupings, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction. Reinforcement learning involves agents learning to make sequences of decisions by receiving rewards or penalties from the environment.

Feature selection and preprocessing are critical steps to ensure high-quality input data. Model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score help assess performance. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation improve model generalization. Machine learning is a foundational technology in AI systems, enabling intelligent applications, predictive analytics, and data-driven decision-making across industries.
