Data Science is the interdisciplinary field of extracting knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines statistics, programming, and domain expertise to make data-driven decisions. Python and R are the most popular languages in data science, offering libraries for analysis, machine learning, and visualization. SQL is commonly used for querying relational databases, while tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Excel are used for reporting and dashboards.

The data science workflow typically involves data collection, cleaning, exploration, modeling, and evaluation. Preprocessing ensures high-quality input data, while feature engineering, selection, and transformation improve model accuracy. Common tasks include predictive modeling, regression, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection. Visualization is used to communicate results effectively to stakeholders, enabling actionable insights.

Data science has applications across industries such as finance, healthcare, marketing, and logistics. It helps organizations optimize operations, forecast trends, and improve decision-making. By bridging the gap between raw data and business strategy, data science enables organizations to leverage data as a strategic asset, making it a crucial component of modern enterprise operations.
