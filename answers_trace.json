        "query": "Explain RAG",
        "answer": "RAG can be applied in multiple domains, including customer support, research summarization, healthcare, and finance. It enables AI agents to answer queries about domain-specific documents, such as reports, papers, or knowledge articles. By combining retrieval and generation, RAG systems offer both flexibility and reliability.\n\nAdvantages of RAG include improved factual accuracy, scalability to large knowledge bases, and the ability to update knowledge dynamically without retraining the model. Implementing RAG involves selecting an embedding model, designing a retrieval system, and integrating it with an LLM, creating an effective agentic system that reasons and retrieves in tandem. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that combines information retrieval with large language models (LLMs) to improve the accuracy and relevance of generated responses. Instead of relying solely on the knowledge encoded in the LLM, RAG retrieves relevant documents or data from a knowledge base (KB) and uses this context to generate informed answers.\n\nThe RAG workflow typically involves two main components: a retriever and a generator. The retriever searches a set of documents, vector embeddings, or a database to find content relevant to the userâ€™s query. These retrieved documents are then passed to the generator, often an LLM, which reasons over the context and produces a concise, accurate response. This reduces hallucinations and ensures the output is grounded in real information. In practical applications, AI agents are used for chatbots, virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, trading bots, and workflow automation. They can retrieve information from knowledge bases, interact with APIs, execute tasks, and reason using LLMs. Integrating RAG with AI agents enables them to answer domain-specific questions accurately while deciding whether to use their internal knowledge or external tools.\n\nDesigning effective AI agents involves considerations like context awareness, error handling, transparency, and ethical behavior. Logging decisions, actions, and reasoning steps is essential for monitoring, evaluation, and improving agent performance. By combining retrieval, reasoning, and action execution, AI agents form the foundation of intelligent, autonomous systems in many domains.",

        "answer": "Chatbots are AI-powered programs designed to simulate human conversation and assist users with tasks or information. They are widely used in customer support, e-commerce, healthcare, education, and entertainment. Chatbots can operate through messaging platforms, websites, or voice interfaces, providing instant responses to user queries and automating repetitive interactions.\n\nModern chatbots leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand user intent, extract entities, and generate contextually appropriate responses. Rule-based chatbots follow predefined scripts, while AI-driven chatbots, powered by machine learning and large language models like GPT, can handle more complex, free-form queries. They can summarize documents, provide recommendations, and even simulate natural conversation. In customer service, chatbots reduce workload by answering FAQs, guiding users through processes, and escalating complex issues to human agents. In healthcare, they assist with symptom checking, appointment scheduling, and patient education. Educational chatbots can provide tutoring, answer subject-related questions, and personalize learning experiences.\n\nDeploying chatbots effectively requires attention to usability, conversational design, and ethical considerations. Privacy and data security are critical, especially when handling sensitive user information. Continuous training and feedback loops improve chatbot accuracy and user satisfaction. By combining AI reasoning with automation, chatbots are becoming essential tools for improving efficiency, engagement, and accessibility across multiple domains. AI agents are being used in chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer support systems. They can answer domain-specific questions, summarize documents, and automate repetitive tasks.
